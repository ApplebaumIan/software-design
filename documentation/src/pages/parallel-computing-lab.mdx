# CIS 3296 Parallel Computing Lab SSH Tutorial

For this weeks lab we will make use of Temple's CIS Linux servers heavily. This means that you will need to employ ssh to login to the server. The tricky part is that we are not just SSHing into one server, but tunneling into servers that are inaccessible outside of Temple's network. This lab is **impossible** to complete locally and must be ran on the `chinook` server.

So how do we do this? We can use a variety of text editors and IDEs to remotely edit the code on the linux server, or you could use vim or emacs to edit the code directly on the server (I used emacs back when I completed this lab 😅). You are probably more comfortable with a more modern tool such as VSCode, so for this example, we will use VSCode. We will need to do the following.

1. Create an `.ssh/config` file with all of Temple's servers that we wish to tunnel through.
2. Create an ssh key and add it to each server so that we don't need to type in a password everytime we change code.
3. git clone the lab on the `chinook` server using another ssh key so that we can commit and push code to GitHub without personal access tokens.
4. Setup VSCode for remote code editing.

## 1. SSH config file

On your Mac or Linux PC, open up your terminal and run the following command (unless you already have an `.ssh/config` file.)

```
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

This command creates an empty `config` text file. Next we will populate it with the list of Temple Servers.

Use `nano` or any text editor you prefer to copy and paste the following.

```config
Host cis-linux2.temple.edu
  HostName cis-linux2.temple.edu
  User tug54949
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host osprey_outside_temple
  HostName osprey.cis.temple.edu
  User tug54949
  ProxyJump cis-linux2.temple.edu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host osprey_inside_temple
  HostName 129.32.95.19
  User tug54949
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host chinook_outside_temple
  HostName chinook.cis.temple.edu
  User tug54949
  ProxyJump osprey_outside_temple
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host chinook_inside_temple
  HostName chinook.cis.temple.edu
  User tug54949
  ProxyJump osprey_inside_temple
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Of course replace your `User` name with your AccessNet name.

Next, notice that we have an `IdentityFile` listed in the `config` file. This is the path to our ssh key, but we haven't actually created this yet. We do this by running `ssh-keygen`.

## 2. Create SSH Key and add it to each server.

```shell
ssh-keygen
```

```shell title="save your key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can skip all of the steps by hitting enter.

```shell title="successful creation of key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:kxdpmge4naR5MduBlrGu5ndLACgQ5sL6VpgkjuTz81A ianapplebaum@Ian-Applebaums-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|oo      .        |
|+.   . . = .     |
|o+o . o X =      |
|Bo +   X % o     |
|o+o .E+ S +      |
| .o..  o =       |
|  o+  o   .      |
| .  +o  ...      |
|     ... ...     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

:::warning MacOS Ventura
If you are on MacOS Ventura or above you'll need to edit your Mac's ssh config file using `sudo` privlages. [See OSXDaily's *How to Fix SSH Not Working on MacOS Ventura*.](https://osxdaily.com/2022/12/22/fix-ssh-not-working-macos-rsa-issue/)
:::

Now we need to copy this key to each server, this part is tedious, but worth it. We need to run `ssh-copy-id` on `cis-linux2`, `osprey`, and `chinook` in that order.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value={1} label={"On Campus 🦉"}>
        <p>You'll be prompted to enter your password after running each command.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
                >
                    {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cis-linux2.temple.edu`}
                </CodeBlock>
            </li>
            <li>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
                >
                    {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub osprey_inside_temple`}
                </CodeBlock>
            </li>
            <li>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
                >
                    {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub chinook_inside_temple`}
                </CodeBlock>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value={2} label={"At Home 🏠"}>
        <p>You'll be prompted to enter your password after running each command.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
        >
            {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cis-linux2.temple.edu`}
        </CodeBlock>
        </li>
            <li><CodeBlock language="bash"
            >
                {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub osprey_outside_temple`}
            </CodeBlock></li>
            <li><CodeBlock language="bash"
            >
                {`ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub chinook_outside_temple`}
            </CodeBlock></li></ol>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should now be able to freely ssh into each server without a password. Try it!

Now lets clone the repository on `chinook`.

## 3. git clone the repo on chinook

First we need to ssh into `chinook` keep in mind the command changes whether you are connected to Temple's Wi-Fi network.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value={1} label={"On Campus 🦉"}>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
                >
                    {`ssh chinook_inside_temple`}
                </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value={2} label={"At Home 🏠"}>
                <CodeBlock language="bash"
                >
                    {`ssh chinook_outside_temple`}
                </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next we will create another ssh key that will be used to clone the GitHub repository securely.


```shell
ssh-keygen
```

```shell title="save your key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can skip all of the steps by hitting enter.

```shell title="successful creation of key"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/ianapplebaum/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:kxdpmge4naR5MduBlrGu5ndLACgQ5sL6VpgkjuTz81A ianapplebaum@Ian-Applebaums-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|oo      .        |
|+.   . . = .     |
|o+o . o X =      |
|Bo +   X % o     |
|o+o .E+ S +      |
| .o..  o =       |
|  o+  o   .      |
| .  +o  ...      |
|     ... ...     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

You'll need to copy your public key to your clipboard.



<Tabs>
    <TabItem value={1} label={"using pbcopy"}>
        <CodeBlock language="bash"
        >
            {"pbcopy < /Users/YOUR_USER_DIRECTORY/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value={2} label={"using cat"}>
        <CodeBlock language="bash" title={"manually copy the output"}
        >
            {"cat /Users/YOUR_USER_DIRECTORY/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With your public key copied to your clipboard login to https://github.com
Tap on your profile in the top right corner as seen in [Figure 1.1](#figure-1) and click Settings. You will then navigate to the *SSH and GPG Keys* menu on the Settings page. click ["New SSH Key"](#figure-1--2) and paste your public key that should be on your clipboard.

import navSettings from "../../static/img/nav-to-settings.png"
import navToKeys from "../../static/img/nav-to-keys.png"
import addImg from "../../static/img/add-keys.png"
import clone from "../../static/img/clone-using-ssh.png"

<Figure src={navSettings} caption={"Figure 1.1 Navigate to Settings page."} id={"figure-1"} />
<Figure src={navToKeys} caption={"Figure 1.2 Navigate to SSH and GPG Keys."} id={"figure-1--2"} />
<Figure src={addImg} caption={"Figure 1.3 Paste SSH Key."} id={"figure-1--3"} />

You may now clone the lab using SSH.

<Figure src={clone} caption={"Figure 1.4 Clone the repository making sure that you selected the SSH tab."} id={"figure-1--4"} />

```
git clone git@github.com:cis3296s23/matrix-YOUR-TEAM-NAME.git
```

## 3. VSCode Remote Code editing

In VSCode, install the ["Visual Studio Code Remote – SSH" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) by Microsoft. Once installed you will then use it to connect to chinook by clicking the bottom left corner as seen in [Figure 2.1](#figure-2--1), and then clicking `chinook_outside_temple` from the list of connections as seen in [Figure 2.2](#figure-2--2).

import vsCodeConnectHost from "../../static/img/vscode-connect-to-host.png"
import vsCodeConnectChinook from "../../static/img/vscode-connect-chinook.png"
import vsCodeMake from "../../static/img/run-make-on-chinook.png"

<Figure src={vsCodeConnectHost} caption="Figure 2.1 VSCode Connect to host button." id={"figure-2--1"}/>
<Figure src={vsCodeConnectChinook} caption="Figure 2.2 Connect to chinook server." id={"figure-2--2"}/>

Next you'll run the Makefile on the server by clicking `Terminal > New Terminal` and running

```
make all
```

shown in [Figure 2.3](#figure-2--3).

<Figure src={vsCodeMake} caption="Figure 2.3 Run make on chinook." id={"figure-2--3"}/>

Follow the rest of the instructions on Canvas for running the lab.
