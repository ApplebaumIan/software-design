[Event storming](https://www.eventstorming.com) is a workshop-based method to quickly find out what is happening in the domain of a software program (or entire business initiative). There are 5 steps to the process, but we only realistically have time for 2 for this activity.

## Project Teams

This semester, my section has four projects. Two Mobile Applications, One chat integration, and a Progressive Web Applictaion. Each project team is comprised of 5-6 students. see the following table for project descriptions.

| Project Name            | Rough Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discord Class           | Discord is a popular chat application that many college students use. This project proposes to make a learning management system for a college that could be run entirely within the discord chat application using a series of text commands for turning in assignments, quizzes, and other relevant coursework. |
| Group Meet              | Group meet is an application to help remove friction for students starting a group project. It allows students with cell phones to simply scan a code and share their contact information and schedules.                                                                                                          |
| Study Buddy Virtual Pet | Study buddy virtual pet tries to "gameify" studying by adding a virtual pet that you take care of by studying. Much like the popular Tamagotchi toy from the late 90s early 2000s.                                                                                                                                |
| Tool Shed               | Tool shed is an application that is trying to help users plan and rent community owned tools for their various home improvement projects.                                                                                                                                                                         |

### 1. Discover Events

Events are things that happen in your application. They are written in the past tense. Let's say we're hypothetically designing a smart coffee maker. One event that would happen in the coffee brewing process is:  "_My coffee maker made a loud buzzing sound to let me know the the coffee \`is ready\`_." or "_I drank the coffee made_". You will discover these events silently as a group for 10 minutes adding them to the top row of the Miro board as **orange sticky notes** (order does not matter in this step just write as many events as you can think of). 

![Discover events](../../static/img/event_discovery.png)

### 2. Enforce Timeline

Take the events discovered in the previous step and start physically ordering them in the second row as a timeline. Discuss as a group if the events fit properly, if there are missing events add them. If an event doesn't make sense or is out of scope, add it to the bottom row known as the parking lot. After reading the time line multiple times, read the timeline backwards. Typically if you're missing an event in the timeline it's a lot more obvious when read backwards. 

![Enforce Timeline](../../static/img/enforce_timeline.png)
**YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE EVENTS THAN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE.**

Why? As we are still finalizing the Requirements Document, this exercise helps us gather requirements WITH the customer. 

For this class we will focus mainly on discovering the Events that happen in your project, and ordering them into a cohesive timeline.
