As this is a writing-intensive course, students are required to submit written assignments that go through an iterative writing cycle: a student submits an assignment, the instructor gives feedback on the assignment, student revises and resubmits work, and the instructor assigns a grade for the revised version. Writing assignments in this course will be grounded in the expression of technical computer science concepts and are designed to help students to develop and practice skills in writing for the computer science discipline.

You will learn to write various technical documents [see Documentation](/docs/intro) during the life cycle of a software development project. The artifacts at the end of phase will be graded. **The initial grading score may be lower,** but please **don't panic**, feedback and comments will be provided. **Students are expected to revise their documentation and resubmit them prior to final grading.** The revised document will be graded iteratively, and a better score be given if the revision meets the expectation of instructor's feedback/comments.
