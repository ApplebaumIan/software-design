# Singleton Pattern in JavaScript

In this tutorial, we’ll go step-by-step to build the **Singleton Pattern** in JavaScript. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Let's walk through each step and build it together.

## Step 1: Why Singleton?

Before we dive into code, let’s understand why we might need a Singleton. Imagine we’re building a **logger utility** or a **database connection** in an app. We don’t want multiple instances of a logger or database connection floating around because it can lead to issues like inconsistent data or excessive resource usage.

With the Singleton pattern, we can make sure that only one instance of a class is created, and we can access it globally.

## Step 2: Start the Singleton Class

We’ll start by creating the basic structure of our `Singleton` class. This class will eventually be designed to ensure it only creates one instance.

Add the following code:
```jsx live
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }

    this.data = "This is the only instance!";
    Singleton.instance = this;
  }

  getData() {
    return this.data;
  }
}

const instance1 = new Singleton();
<div>{instance1.getData()}</div>
```
