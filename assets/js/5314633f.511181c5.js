When a phone receives an SMS or Email, the text message is transferred from the phone to the headunit through a Bluetooth connection. On the headunit, user can control which and when the received SMS or E-mail to be read out through the in-vehicle audio system. The user may press one button on the headunit to activate the hands-free feature to call back the SMS sender.\n\n### High Level Requirement\nDescribe the requirements \u2013 i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view \u2013 at a high level.\n\n### Conceptual Design\nDescribe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.\n\n### Required Resources\nDiscuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.\n\n### Background & References\nThe background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products.
